# M.O.M. — My Organic Memory

**Your life, remembered. The way a mother would.**

M.O.M. is an encrypted, governed life graph that prioritizes recall by **context + emotional salience + continuity rules**, then surfaces the right memory at the right moment.

This is not notes.
This is not search.
This is **memory with governance**.

## Why it exists

Most memory apps do retrieval.
M.O.M. does **continuity**: no silent retcons, no creepy nudges, no shadow sharing.

## The Spine (IP + architecture)

M.O.M. is built on four primitives:

- **MemNode™** — a governed memory object (encrypted payload + metadata + consent)
- **Corridors™** — typed relationships with traversal constraints (policy-bearing edges)
- **Coda™** — append-only provenance + version-lock (no overwrite guarantees)
- **StagePort™** — fail-closed policy enforcement boundary (privacy-first, keys-first)

Marketing skin (“calling mom”) is optional. The spine is enforceable.

## Guarantees (non-negotiable)

- **End-to-end encryption** (user-held keys or user-authorized device keys)
- **Append-only history** (every change is versioned; no silent rewrites)
- **Per-node consent flags** (recall / link / nudge / family / export)
- **Safe nudges only** (strict constitution; minimal disclosure; rate-limited)
- **Cited recall** (answers cite supporting nodes)

## Specs

- `specs/SYSTEM_SPEC_v1.1.md` — schema + invariants (MemNode / Corridors / Coda / StagePort)
- `specs/RULESET_NUDGE_CONSTITUTION_v1.0.md` — when M.O.M. may push
- `specs/THREAT_MODEL_v1.0.md` — explicit refusals + mitigations

## Status

Early architecture + spec staking.
Implementation is staged as:

- v0: capture + governed recall + calendar-conflict guardian
- v1: integrations + associative recall + morning brief
- v1.5: redaction masks + cross-device sync with user-held keys
