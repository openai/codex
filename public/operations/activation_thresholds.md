# SYVAQ × AVC — Activation Thresholds

Document ID: TDC-01-OPS-AT  
Audience: Engineering, Risk, Legal  
Status: Canonical (v1)

## Purpose

This document defines the activation threshold as a technical and liability gate, translating financial posture into operational boundaries.

## Threshold Definition

**Activation Threshold**  
$2,500 is the minimum activation threshold required to:

- License AVC governance infrastructure.
- Unlock controlled deployment and representation.
- Assume professional liability for MVP systems.

Below this threshold, no deployment, guarantees, or exposure occur.

## Engineering Consequences

Activation shifts what is permissible:

- Feature exposure becomes license-bound.
- Deployment rights are explicitly granted.
- Governance enforcement is non-optional.

No partial or informal activation paths exist.

## Risk Rationale

The threshold is a structural risk boundary, not a sales tactic. It prevents silent expansion of responsibility before governance and audit posture are active.

## Summary

Activation is not a milestone. It is a permission boundary that protects both system integrity and liability clarity.
