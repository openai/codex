AVC StagePort Production Release v1.0

Prepared for professional review

1. What This Package Is
This is a controlled production release containing discrete, versioned subsystems related to authorship, product development, operational records, legal posture, narrative structure, and evidentiary materials associated with the StagePort body of work.

All materials are preserved in their original packaged form to maintain provenance, version integrity, and review clarity.

This package is not a narrative presentation. It is a compiled release artifact.

2. How This Package Is Structured
Each folder contains one intact ZIP, representing a sovereign subsystem.
No internal ZIP contents have been modified, merged, or recombined.

01_CORE_RECORD            → Authorship & provenance
02_PRODUCT_AND_SYSTEM     → Productized intelligence & demos
03_OPERATIONS             → Operational and ledger records
04_LEGAL_AND_RIGHTS       → Legal posture & rights signaling
05_CASE_NARRATIVE         → Narrative freeze-frame (act structure)
06_EVIDENCE_CONTROLLED    → Restricted evidentiary materials
07_PUBLIC_PREVIEW         → Public-safe artifact

This separation is intentional and must be preserved.
