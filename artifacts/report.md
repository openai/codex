   > This guide provides a design framework and implementation approach for AI agent systems that operate autonomously while remaining controllable and aligned with your goals. It connects event-driven architectural patterns with various agentic alternatives, demonstrating how to build production-grade agent systems using cloud-native architectures. The following subjects are discussed in this guide:

   > Awesome Agentic Patterns A curated catalogue of agentic AI patterns — real‑world tricks, workflows, and mini‑architectures that help autonomous or semi‑autonomous AI agents get useful work done in production. Why? Tutorials show toy demos. Real products hide the messy bits. This list surfaces the repeatable patterns that bridge the gap so we can all ship smarter, faster agents .

   > In many AI frameworks and libraries, it's common to see agents make calls directly to other agents . There are new protocols popping up every day to facilitate agent communications like the Agent -to- Agent protocol (A2A), Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) which supports tools that might be involved in a larger agentic orchestration .
