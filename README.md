## Quickstart

### Installing and running Codex CLI

Install globally with your preferred package manager:

```shell
# Install using npm
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

```shell
# Install using Homebrew
brew install --cask codex
```

Then simply run `codex` to get started.

<details>
<summary>You can also go to the <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/latest">latest GitHub Release</a> and download the appropriate binary for your platform.</summary>

Each GitHub Release contains many executables, but in practice, you likely want one of these:

- macOS
  - Apple Silicon/arm64: `codex-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
  - x86_64 (older Mac hardware): `codex-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
- Linux
  - x86_64: `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`
  - arm64: `codex-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`

Each archive contains a single entry with the platform baked into the name (e.g., `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`), so you likely want to rename it to `codex` after extracting it.

### Using Codex with your ChatGPT plan

Run `codex` and select **Sign in with ChatGPT**. We recommend signing into your ChatGPT account to use Codex as part of your Plus, Pro, Team, Edu, or Enterprise plan. [Learn more about what's included in your ChatGPT plan](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11369540-codex-in-chatgpt).

You can also use Codex with an API key, but this requires [additional setup](https://developers.openai.com/codex/auth#sign-in-with-an-api-key).

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>macOS: Network calls fail even with <code>network_access = true</code></strong></summary>

On macOS, the seatbelt sandbox unconditionally blocks outbound network access regardless of your `config.toml` settings. Commands that require network (cloud CLIs, curl, API clients, package managers) will fail with connection timeouts.

**Symptoms:**
- `CODEX_SANDBOX_NETWORK_DISABLED=1` is set in the sandbox environment
- `network_access = true` under `[sandbox_workspace_write]` in `~/.codex/config.toml` has no effect
- Network commands time out or report host unreachable

**Workaround — use the CLI flag:**

```shell
codex --sandbox danger-full-access "your prompt"
```

Or add a persistent alias to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc` / `~/.bashrc`):

```shell
alias codex='CODEX_SANDBOX_NETWORK_DISABLED=0 codex --sandbox danger-full-access'
```

> **Note:** `--sandbox danger-full-access` disables all sandbox restrictions. Only use this in environments you trust. See [#10390](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/10390) for details and a proposed fix.
