Configure the system fallback topic 2024-11-19 Feedback In this article During a conversation, a Microsoft Copilot Studio agent triggers the appropriate topic based on the user's input. If the agent can't determine the user's intent, it prompts the user again. After two prompts, the custom or Copilot agent escalates to a live representative through a system topic called Escalate . You can customize how the agent behaves when user input doesn't trigger any topic. For example, you can build a catchall topic to capture unrecognized user intent, create a topic to call back-end systems, or route a topic to existing services. Customize the fallback topic and behavior in the default system Fallback topic. A fallback topic triggers On Unknown Intent to capture the unrecognized input. View the default system fallback topic Open your agent in Copilot Studio. At the top of the page, select Topics > System , then open the Fallback topic. You see the flow for the system fallback topic with two main nodes: Message and Redirect . The topic has a condition to ask the user no more than twice to rephrase their question. If the agent still doesn't understand the question, the conversation is redirected. The redirection causes the Escalate system topic to trigger. Note In Microsoft Teams, there's no default system fallback topic. But you can always create one. Customize the system fallback topic You can customize this topic as with any other system topic . You can also use variables , such as UnrecognizedTriggerPhrase , that store the user's input if the agent can't understand. For example, you can use a variable as an input and pass it to a Power Automate flow or Bot Framework skill . Note Since the fallback topic captures unknown content from the user, it doesn't have any trigger phrases. Reset system fallback behavior by deleting the fallback topic You can return a system fallback topic to its default behavior. Select the ... on the top menu bar. Select Reset to default . Warning Setting a topic back to its default removes any changes you made to it. Feedback Was this page helpful? Yes No No Need help with this topic?

Copilot Studio - Topic Creation & Management Answered Fallback Topic is triggering after Conversational Boosting generates an answer. Subscribe ( 0 ) Share Report Posted on by JaseOfSpades Since the UI was modernised recently, my fallback topic has started triggering even when the Conversational Boosting Topic creates an answer using the Create generative answers step. I can't say for sure if this is related to the recent changes, but I can't seem to figure out a way to stop it fallback Topic from triggering when the answer is created. My guess is that it has something to do with the fact that both Topics are via 'On Unknown Intent' but changing the priority doesn't do anything. So I assume that I will need to set the Answer variable to something, though this was automatic beforehand.

Hi @JaseOfSpades recently attempted similar steps with generative answers and did not encounter this issue. Please try creating a new Chatbot and check again. Additionally, you can end the execution by adding an End Topic/End Conversation node.

Yes No Verified answer JaseOfSpades on at Like ( 1 ) Report Re: Fallback Topic is triggering after Conversational Boosting generates an answer. Thanks, @Umianta Creating a new copilot did indeed remove the issue of it answering it but still saying it couldn't answer the question. However, for those that have put more time into their copilots than I initially had and didn't want to recreate them, here was another solution that me and a colleague put together to remove the issue without recreating your already established copilot: It would seem that the main issue was that it was going to the Fallback topic even if the conversational boosting topic found an answer. The System.FallbackCount returned as 0 when we got an answer generated but if it was unable to find an answer it would be 1 or more depending on how many attempts it tried to find an answer via the user rephrasing their prompt. So to resolve this (as seen in the topic screenshot above), we added nested conditions to handle the instances that it would have the answer (System.FallbackCount = 0) and when it couldn't find an answer (System.FallbackCount not 0). The additional checks based on FallbackCount are simply to allow for an alternative text being returned after so many attempts. Was this reply helpful?

We have also created our custom fallback set-up topic. The same setup topic is also configured in the 'Conversation Interface > Settings > Virtual Agent > Custom Greetings and Setup > Default Chat Experience > Setup Topics > Fallback' setup topic type. We want that if the users enters something completely gibberish as an utterance (such as ' sdjkfkhs fsdkhfsjkdfh ksjdfhiosuf isueioursoi fcu439934r' ) that the VA is not able to predict any intent/topic for, the fallback topic response should get triggered. However, currently when user enter any gibberish text, the response is the value configured in the system property: 'com.glide.cs.general.retry_question_message' As we notice from the 'open_nlu_predict_intent_feedback.list' table, the NLU is not predicting any intent or model for the gibberish utterance. How can we make the bot respond with the custom fallback response when the user enters a gibberish utterance and no intent/topic is predicted? Any help on this will be very appreciated.

The two things I would look for is this: 1) In your custom greetings and setup, is there any value in your AI Search Fallback above your Fallback topic? If so, you may want to remove it for testing. The default topic (AI Search-Fallback) executes a search, then if not helpful, calls the value in fallback setup topic. 2) In your custom fallback topic, do you execute a search first? I believe the Search Fallback uses a topic block for search (contextual or AI - and they are different subprocesses)- it might be going through the search routine first. Seems counter-intuitive (and I'm not quite sure why), but I've switched from testing gibberish to testing utterances that are absolutely not in the instance ("what's for dinner"). Your gibberish contains numbers (by accident) but that could impact your searching.
