# Codex de Ballet™ Digital Product Concept

## Vision

Codex de Ballet™ is a permissioned, revenue-generating extension of the PyRouette ecosystem that preserves, codifies, and activates choreographic works as executable media. Built on the Etudes & Repetoile Archive and the Codex Sylphidianus myth-tech framework, the product offers dance institutions a way to secure authorship, monetize repertoire, and gain access to a living ledger of programmable ballet scores.

## Value Proposition

- **Preserve repertory with authority.** Encode classical or original ballets as `.rouette` scores that preserve style, structure, and lineage.
- **Generate new revenue streams.** License Codex Folios, custom renderings, and remix permissions to companies, schools, and collectors.
- **Assert intellectual property ownership.** Timestamped codex licenses and glitch-watermarked outputs stake claim over choreographic authorship before generative systems can extract it.
- **Deliver immediate utility.** Provide companies with a ready-to-teach, ready-to-stage set of digital materials that bridge archival depth and performance readiness.

## Delivery Workflow

1. **Intake & Alignment** – Discovery session, repertory selection, IP objectives, signature of preliminary memorandum.
2. **Motion Capture / Score Translation** – Convert movement material into PyRouette Pose, Movement, and Dancer objects; embed lineage notes and glitch-watermarks.
3. **Codex Folio Composition** – Design glyphic pages, annotate style lineage, and compile marginalia in the Codex aesthetic.
4. **Render & Verification** – Generate Glisscode visualization, review with artistic staff, and adjust for fidelity.
5. **Licensing & Release** – Issue Codex License, deliver digital assets, onboard staff into ritual/usage protocols, and record ledger entry.
6. **Ongoing Stewardship** – Optional updates, remix authorizations, curriculum integration, and marketplace listing preparation.

## Immediate Next Actions

1. Finalize pricing matrices and draft master service agreements for each tier.
2. Produce two sample Codex Folios (one classical, one contemporary) as sales collateral.
3. Build landing page and intake form describing tiers, deliverables, and licensing philosophy.
4. Set up ledger infrastructure (encrypted database or Git-based registry) for timestamping delivered codices.
5. Announce pilot cohort recruitment to targeted institutions and choreographers.

## Strategic Notes

- Use Codex Sylphidianus excerpts to signal exclusivity and poetic authority; full access remains invitation-only.
- Each Codex Folio should include a visible glitch-watermark and attribution instructions to reinforce authorship.
- Package "Choreographic Claim Kits" for solo creators to secure IP rapidly and feed future marketplace inventory.
- Align messaging with the urgency of safeguarding embodied intelligence before commodification by generic AI systems.
