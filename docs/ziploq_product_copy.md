# ZIPloq™ — Sealed Systems Pack (No Calls)

Seal the work. Get paid.

ZIPloq is a sealed, audit-grade package that turns your upstream intelligence into sellable infrastructure: doctrine + offers + pricing + gates.

No sessions. No “pick your brain.” No performance.

You’re buying constraints that hold under stress.

## What you get (download)

PDF + ZIP bundle

- Company Bible Core (mission, thesis, operating rules)
- Offer Ladder (3–5 offers, scoped + named + priced)

- Intake Gate (self-qualification form template)
- License + Terms (light) (usage + sharing limits)
- Decision Record template (keeps your work provable)

### License (Personal / Studio)

By purchasing ZIPloq, you receive a non-transferable license to use the materials for your own business/studio/internal operations.

You may:

- Use the templates and language in your own internal docs and offers.
- Modify for your own use.
- Distribute inside your organization/team.

You may not:

- Resell, redistribute, or repackage ZIPloq (in whole or part).
- Publish the templates as your own product, course, or lead magnet.
- Share the files publicly or upload to open repos.

### Confidentiality / Non-Disclosure

ZIPloq is delivered as static artifacts. If you purchase BLACKLABEL and submit materials for review, treat that exchange as confidential on both sides.

### Refunds

Because this is a digital download, refunds are not offered once files are delivered.  
If you have a corrupted download or access issue, you’ll be made whole immediately (replacement files).

### Delivery

Instant download upon purchase (or within 24 hours if a platform flags delivery).  
BLACKLABEL review turnaround is stated on the product page and begins once materials are received.

### AI / Tooling Notice

ZIPloq may include language and templates produced with the assistance of tools, but the package is curated into a cohesive system and licensed as a compiled work.

## One-page doctrine

I don’t sell inspiration.  
I sell containers.  
I don’t negotiate price in conversation.  
I publish gates.  
If you want the structure, you license it.
