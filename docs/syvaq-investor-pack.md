# Syvaq × AVC Systems Studio — Investor Pack Architecture (v1)

This document defines a sealed, investor-facing package that communicates capability without exposing internal systems or IP. It is structured to protect scope, pricing boundaries, and operational gravity while remaining legible to funders.

All artifacts are PDFs. No code, no schemas, no reversible diagrams. Screenshots only when needed for clarity.

## 00_READ_ME_FIRST — Control the room

Purpose: establish the relationship boundary, set expectations, and prevent unpaid scope creep.

Key points:

- AVC Systems Studio is R&D infrastructure, not a contractor.
- This pack describes capability and outcomes, not internals.
- Access to working systems, schemas, or code requires paid activation.
- The $2.5K payment is a seriousness threshold, not a courtesy fee.
- Timing pressure or vague requests do not unlock work.

Tone: calm, adult, and unambiguous.

## 01_EXEC_SUMMARY — Short and sober

Audience: founder + any adult decision-maker in the room.

Core positioning:

- AVC Systems Studio designs civic-grade, safety-aware, monetizable infrastructure for creative-tech companies.
- The deliverable is a technical spine that can be raised on, licensed, and defended.
- This is not a free think tank or an endless strategy session.

## 02_THE_PROBLEM_WE_SOLVE — Gen-Z clarity, adult consequences

Spell out the real risk:

- Ideas without infrastructure leak time, energy, and capital.
- Without a defensible system, investment stalls, founders burn out, and IP diffuses.
- The absence of infrastructure is a compounding liability.

## 03_THE_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW — What exists, without revealing how

High-level components only:

- StudioOS logic (operations, safety, credentialing).
- StagePort as differentiation (embodied intelligence and trust posture).
- Civic-tech alignment (compliance-aware, audit-ready).
- Licensable modules, not bespoke chaos.

## 04_PHASED_INVESTMENT_MODEL — The pathway

Describe the investment stages without promising outcomes:

- Phase 1: Activation and scoping.
- Phase 2: Prototype and evidence.
- Phase 3: Raise-ready package and licensing readiness.

## 05*THE*$2.5K_GATE — The threshold

**What it unlocks:**

- Formal activation as R&D partner.
- A time-boxed scoping sprint.
- Infrastructure readiness checklist.
- Google Cloud project setup (account hygiene, not architecture transfer).
- Stripe initialization + flow mapping.
- Licensing frame drafted (not executed).
- Investor-safe language for Syvaq decks.

**What it does not unlock:**

- Source code.
- Internal schemas.
- Engines and proprietary frameworks.
- Ongoing access.
- "Just one more thing" requests.

Position as: **"This is the cost of entering the lab."**

## 06*THE*$20K_BUILD_PLAN — A 90‑day plan with bones

**Month 1: Foundation**

- Google Cloud project setup with billing and IAM hygiene.
- Stripe live payments with receipts and compliance flows.
- One flagship system prototype (closed).
- Licensing boundaries finalized.

**Month 2: Proof**

- One deployable, investor-safe demo.
- Metrics instrumentation.
- Narrative + technical alignment.
- First licensing-ready artifact.

**Month 3: Leverage**

- Raise-ready materials.
- Partner-safe demo.
- Clear expansion paths (enterprise / civic / education).

## 07_INFRASTRUCTURE_AND_COMPLIANCE — Gravity, not upsell

Plain-language framing:

- Google Cloud is credibility, not vibes.
- Stripe is receipts and compliance, not just a money button.
- Licensing is survival, not ego.

## 08_LICENSING_AND_IP_BOUNDARIES — Protect the core

Explicit boundaries:

- AVC retains ownership of core systems.
- Syvaq licenses usage.
- No exclusivity without serious capital.
- No derivative rights without contract.
- No ambiguity about joint ownership.

## 09_RISK_AND_REALITY_CHECK — No fantasy economics

Clarify what this does _not_ promise:

- No guaranteed outcomes.
- No artificial growth curves.
- No misaligned timelines.

## 10_APPENDIX_RANGES_MATRIX — Abstracted scope ranges

A table for pricing and posture without leaking implementation.

Example matrix:

| Category         | Range A                 | Range B                          | Range C                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| CTO involvement  | Advisory ($2.5K–$5K)    | Embedded, non‑equity ($15K–$30K) | Equity + cash ($50K+)           |
| Civic tech depth | Conceptual (deck-level) | Pilot (closed demo)              | Production (compliance + audit) |
| Licensing        | Internal use            | White‑label                      | Enterprise sublicense           |
| Risk posture     | Founder‑led (high)      | System‑led (moderate)            | Licensed (contained)            |

## Tone control

No anger. No apology. No mythology. The document is expensive by design.

## Execution path (internal)

1. Draft PDFs 00–06 in clean, investor‑safe language.
2. Lock the $2.5K language and gating boundaries.
3. Distribute via a single, controlled link.
4. If payment is delayed or avoided, pause.
5. If payment is received, proceed exactly as defined.
