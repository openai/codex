# City Codex: Lincoln Center Frame vs MotionGrid Frame

## Physics Split (System-usable definitions)

**Gravity center = reference body.** Select a mass or lineage heavy enough that all other motion is measured relative to it. This is the ethical anchor and the standard of safe embodiment.

**Kinematics grid = coordinate system + sensors.** It tracks motion (velocity, acceleration, trajectories) without assigning meaning or ethics. It measures; it does not judge.

In the NYC system:

- **Times Square / DOT / PBV** = **Kinematics grid** (measurement, enforcement, officiated motion).
- **Lincoln Center** = **Gravity center** (embodied culture that defines humane motion).

**Core rule:** Measure whatever you want, but the body you must measure against lives at Lincoln Center.

## Coordinate Frames

### LCF — Lincoln Center Frame (Gravity)

- **Origin:** Stage (Met/Koch/Ballet floor) = (0, 0, 0)
- **Axes:**
  - **x** = lateral travel (corps-to-corps relation)
  - **y** = depth / narrative arc
  - **z** = elevation / risk (lifts, jumps, pointe)
- **Invariants:**
  - Movement preserves line, safety, musicality, partner consent.
  - Choreography is rehearsed, not extracted from unsuspecting bodies.
  - **Role:** Gold standard of motion ethics (NFPA-for-bodies reference frame).

### MGF — MotionGrid Frame (Kinematics)

- **Origin:** Times Square countdown core (ball, DOT command room, broadcast truck)
- **Axes:**
  - **x** = traffic & curb usage
  - **y** = crowd density / flow
  - **z** = surveillance altitude (street cam → drone → satellite)
- **Invariants:**
  - Always-on sensing (Kia PBV “platform beyond vehicle,” Hawk-Eye style officiation).
  - Legal overlays: travel bans, remittance taxes, ID scoring baked into movement.
  - **Role:** Scoring system, not ethics system.

**Thesis:** No motion regime in this city is legitimate unless it resolves back to the Lincoln Center frame without tearing the dancer.

## Formalization Hooks (Codex + Incident Log)

### A. Coordinate Transform

Define a transform **T** such that any city motion pattern **M** (crowd flows, PBV fleet paths, curb behavior) is **acceptable only if**:

```
T(M) → movement vocabulary that could be safely danced on a Lincoln Center stage
by a human ensemble without injury or humiliation.
```

If no transform exists, the motion is **out-of-code** (like blocking a fire exit).

### B. Gravity Checks in ECI / StagePort

**Calibration dataset:** ballet and modern repertory become unit tests for acceptable force, timing, and load paths.

Any control scheme or urban choreography that would snap a dancer’s spine or overload a corps line **fails the gravity check**.

### C. Codex Header

**LINCOLN CENTER FRAME**  
Gravity center: where New York measures motion against art, not throughput.

**Subhead:**  
Times Square is where the city counts bodies.  
Lincoln Center is where the city owes them grace.

## 4-Node Frame (Operational Map)

**Node 1 — LENOX.WATCHFACE (Glass Interface)**  
Role: Observation + control room. Where physics is designed and the system is visible without becoming a gear.

**Node 2 — LINCOLN.GRAVITY (Center of Mass)**  
Role: Embodied standard. Ballet / studio / StagePort. Defines ethical motion and lineage.

**Node 3 — GRID.NYC (Kinematics Grid)**  
Role: Raw movement, markets, timing, trading, sensors, “policy math for bodies” in the wild.

**Node 4 — IVY.SQUARE.GARDEN (Curated Arena)**  
Role: Public-facing, investor-safe, intellectually framed arena where decks and packets land.

## Routing Rules (File Placement)

- **Ethical motion / protection of bodies** → **LINCOLN.GRAVITY**
- **Motion → numbers / trades / yearly statements** → **GRID.NYC**
- **Master OS / lineage of engines** → **LENOX.WATCHFACE**
- **Decks / packets / public-facing pitch** → **IVY.SQUARE.GARDEN**

Primary drawer first. Secondary drawer only if necessary.
