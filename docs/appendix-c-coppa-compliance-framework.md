# Appendix C — Children’s Online Privacy (COPPA) Compliance Framework

(Aligned with 15 U.S.C. §§ 6501–6506; 16 CFR Part 312, as amended 2025)

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This Appendix applies only where any online activity, platform, or digital tool used in connection with covered programs involves the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information from children under thirteen (13) years of age, thereby triggering the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).

This Appendix does not convert the Custodian into an “operator” under COPPA, nor does it apply to purely offline activities.

## 2. Verifiable Parental Consent Requirement

Where COPPA applies, no personal information from a child under 13 shall be collected, used, or disclosed without verifiable parental consent, except as expressly permitted under limited statutory exceptions (e.g., one-time parental contact requests or internal support operations).

Consent must be obtained prior to collection and must be reasonably designed, in light of available technology, to ensure the consenting party is the child’s parent or legal guardian.

## 3. Approved Consent Methods

Verifiable parental consent shall be obtained using FTC-approved methods under 16 CFR § 312.5(b), including but not limited to:

- Signed written consent returned by mail, scan, or electronic upload.
- Credit/debit card or equivalent online payment verification.
- Live telephone or video confirmation.
- “Email-plus” mechanisms for lower-risk, internal uses.
- Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA) using dynamic, multiple-choice questions with low guessing probability and difficulty beyond what a child under 13 could reasonably ascertain.
- Government-issued photo ID verification with facial comparison, with prompt deletion of ID and biometric data after verification.
- Text-plus methods, where permitted, and only when no third-party disclosure of the child’s personal information occurs.

Selection of method shall follow a risk-based (sliding-scale) approach, with stronger verification required for higher-risk uses or disclosures.

## 4. Separate Consent for Third-Party Disclosure

Any disclosure of a child’s personal information to third parties, including for targeted advertising, monetization, or cross-context behavioral purposes, requires separate, explicit, verifiable parental consent, distinct from consent for initial collection or internal use.

Participation shall not be conditioned on granting such disclosure consent.

## 5. Data Minimization, Retention, and Security

- Collection shall be limited to information reasonably necessary for the stated artistic, educational, or operational purpose.
- Personal information shall be retained only as long as necessary, then securely deleted.
- Reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards shall be maintained to protect confidentiality and integrity.

## 6. Parental Rights

Parents shall be provided with clear notice of their rights, including the right to:

- Review personal information collected from their child.
- Request deletion.
- Refuse or revoke further collection or use.

## 7. Public Attribution and Media

Any public identification, attribution, image, audio, or video involving a child under 13 that constitutes personal information shall require verifiable parental consent, regardless of whether participation itself is otherwise permitted.

## 8. Custodian Role Limitation

The Custodian shall:

- Use any child-related information solely for authorized custodial purposes.
- Maintain reasonable security safeguards.
- Not redisclose personal information except as authorized or required by law.

Nothing in this Appendix imposes operator status, advertising obligations, or commercial data duties on the Custodian.

## 9. Regulatory Alignment

This Appendix is intended to remain future-proof and shall be interpreted consistent with:

- FTC guidance and enforcement interpretations.
- Amendments effective June 23, 2025, with general compliance by April 22, 2026.
- Any successor regulations or FTC-approved safe harbor standards.
