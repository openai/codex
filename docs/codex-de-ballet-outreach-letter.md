**Subject:** Introducing Codex de Ballet™ — Preserving Repertoire as Executable Memory

Dear [Artistic Director / Executive Director],

My name is Allison Van Cura, and I am the creator of PyRouette—an emerging choreographic operating system that treats ballet as a programmable, preservable language. I’m reaching out to invite [Company Name] into Codex de Ballet™, a new initiative designed to safeguard repertory, unlock fresh revenue pathways, and translate choreography into executable, teachable digital scores.

Codex de Ballet™ transforms a selected work from your repertoire into a living codex package that includes:

- A **PyRouette `.rouette` score** that preserves poses, transitions, dynamics, and stylistic metadata.
- A **Codex Folio**—a glyph-driven, illustrated score inspired by the Codex Sylphidianus aesthetic, suitable for archival or educational use.
- A **Glisscode render** that delivers a visual, replayable representation for rehearsal, education, or donor engagement.
- A **Codex License & Ledger Entry** that timestamps authorship, defines performance rights, and protects your IP against extraction by emerging generative systems.

This isn’t software in the corporate sense; it is a ritualized digital edition of your work that lives inside an executable ballet canon. We designed it to serve the same role that the Balanchine Trust plays for neoclassical masterpieces—except our format is code, glyph, and glitch-protected memory.

I would love to schedule a brief conversation to explore how Codex de Ballet™ might preserve and amplify your repertory, or even co-create new work that is native to the PyRouette environment. Early partners receive preferred licensing terms and the opportunity to help shape the Codex Sylphidianus canon.

Please let me know a time that suits you, or feel free to reach me directly at [email] or [phone]. Thank you for the extraordinary work you steward—I hope to honor it in this new medium.

With respect and anticipation,

Allison Van Cura  
Founder, PyRouette & Codex de Ballet™
