## 1) The Three Rails (run in parallel)

1. **State Custodian (NY Office of Unclaimed Funds)**  
   File the claim using **Property ID 23619575** and select the correct claimant relationship (likely **Deceased Owner / Estate**).
2. **Holder / Transfer Agent (John Hancock → transfer agent)**  
   Request issuer name, CUSIP, certificate/account numbers, and remittance letter.
3. **Probate / Family Trail (Surrogate’s Court)**  
   Obtain the probate file, Letters Testamentary/Administration, and estate inventory.

## 2) Immediate Actions (first 48 hours)

### A. Preserve evidence (5–10 min)

Create a folder and freeze the facts:

```
/evidence/EV_2003_Property23619575/
  00_manifest.txt
  01_OUF_screenshot_Property23619575.png
  02_JH_email_sent_YYYYMMDD.eml
```

In `00_manifest.txt`, log capture time and the fact that the record shows:

- Property ID 23619575
- Reported 2003
- Reporting business: John Hancock Financial Services
- Owner name shown: Claire A. Vancura / Vancouvera (variant)
- Address: 200 E 64th St, New York, NY 10021

### B. Start the NY claim (15–30 min)

Search by **Property ID 23619575** first (fastest exact match). Start the claim and record the case number.

### C. Email John Hancock (10–15 min)

Use the script below and save the sent email as `.eml` in your evidence folder.

## 7) Escalation Ladder (if blocked)

1. **Transfer agent stonewalls:** ask for written list of required documents and supervisor contact.
2. **No probate file:** request “small estate” or heirship route; get affidavit drafted.

## 8) Mythic but practical mantra

**You are not lost. You are tracing a line.**  
Follow the documents, freeze the evidence, and demand the record. The name may glitch — the proof does not.
