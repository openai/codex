# Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) v1.1

**Contribution, Attribution, and Custodial Accountability**

This Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) is entered into by and between:

[Organization / Institution Name] (“Organization”)  
and  
[Custodial Practice / Lab / Individual Name] (“Custodian”)

**Effective Date:** [Date]

**Header Note:** Section 8.1 (Educational Records & Student Privacy) applies only where the Organization is an educational agency or institution subject to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99). It ensures compliance in applicable contexts without altering other provisions.

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this MOU is to establish clear standards for the documentation, attribution, and custodial protection of artistic and pedagogical contributions associated with programs, productions, curricula, or activities involving the Organization.

This MOU is intended to ensure that creative labor—including contributions made by minors—is accurately recorded and preserved without requiring public exposure, self-advocacy, or narrative control by contributors.

## 2. Principles

The parties agree to the following principles:

- Attribution is a custodial responsibility, not a marketing function.
- Lack of public credit does not imply lack of contribution.
- Exposure is not compensation.
- Contributions made under institutional authority require heightened care.
- Minors’ work must be documented without risk to safety or future autonomy.

## 3. Scope of Contributions

This MOU applies to, but is not limited to, contributions involving:

- choreography and staging
- rehearsal leadership or teaching labor
- curriculum or program development
- creative decision-making
- media participation
- archival or legacy materials

## 4. Contribution Documentation (Internal)

The Organization agrees to maintain internal contribution records for each covered activity, including:

- contributor name or anonymized identifier (for minors)
- role and nature of contribution
- time period and context
- supervising authority or department

These records are maintained for institutional, archival, and reporting purposes and are not public-facing by default.

## 5. Attribution Standards

### 5.1 Internal Attribution (Required)

- Full contribution records shall be retained regardless of public visibility.
- Records shall not be altered retroactively except to correct factual errors.

### 5.2 Public Attribution (Contextual)

Public attribution may include named credit, collective credit, anonymized acknowledgment, or deferred credit, depending on age, consent, safety, and appropriateness.

Public attribution decisions shall not erase or invalidate internal records.

## 6. Special Protections for Minors

When contributors are under eighteen (18) years of age:

- Contributions shall be documented regardless of public attribution.
- Consent is required for any public identification.
- Exposure shall not be treated as compensation.
- Records shall be preserved so contributors may later access or claim their work.

## 7. Custodial Role

The Custodian serves as an independent steward of contribution records and attribution standards.

The Custodian’s responsibilities may include:

- verifying contribution documentation
- advising on attribution practices
- maintaining separation between documentation and publicity
- safeguarding records related to minors
- supporting ethical reporting and audit readiness

The Custodian does not assume operational control or marketing authority.

## 8. Reporting & Compliance

The Organization may use internal contribution records to:

- prepare grant or funding reports
- document educational or cultural impact
- support institutional audits
- respond to future attribution inquiries

Failure to maintain accurate records constitutes a governance lapse, not a contributor failure.

### 8.1 Educational Records & Student Privacy (FERPA Applicability)

Where the Organization is an educational agency or institution subject to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99), the parties agree that contribution records may constitute “education records” containing personally identifiable information (PII).

- Records shall be maintained and accessed in compliance with FERPA, including providing parents or eligible students (students 18 or older) the right to inspect, review, and seek amendment of records upon request (within 45 days).
- Disclosures of PII from records shall require written consent unless an exception applies, such as disclosure to school officials with a legitimate educational interest or for authorized audit/evaluation purposes.
- The Custodian qualifies as a “school official” under FERPA (§ 99.31(a)(1)(i)(B)) when performing outsourced institutional services or functions (e.g., custodial maintenance and verification of contribution records for educational/artistic purposes), provided the Custodian:
  - Performs a function the Organization would otherwise use its own employees to perform;
  - Is under the direct control of the Organization with respect to the use and maintenance of education records (as established by this MOU);
  - Has a legitimate educational interest limited to the purposes outlined herein; and
  - Uses records only for authorized purposes and does not redisclose PII without the Organization’s specific authorization or as otherwise permitted by FERPA (§ 99.33(a)).
- The Organization shall include this MOU in relevant FERPA notifications (e.g., annual rights notice) if designating any contribution-related information as directory information, preserving opt-out rights.
- Records related to minors shall prioritize privacy protections, with any public attribution requiring parental consent.

This section does not alter other MOU provisions but ensures alignment with federal student privacy requirements in applicable educational contexts.

## 9. Intellectual Property

Nothing in this MOU transfers ownership of intellectual property unless explicitly stated in a separate written agreement.

Documentation under this MOU does not imply license, publication rights, or derivative use.

## 10. Term & Termination

This MOU shall remain in effect for [term] and may be terminated by either party with written notice.

Termination does not invalidate contribution records created during the term.

## 11. Non-Retaliation

No contributor shall face retaliation, exclusion, or disadvantage for the existence or accuracy of contribution records maintained under this MOU.

## 12. No Employment Relationship

This MOU does not create an employment, agency, or partnership relationship between the parties.

## 13. Entire Understanding

This MOU represents the entire understanding of the parties with respect to contribution documentation and attribution standards.
