## Five-slide deck

### Slide 1 — Title

- **Title:** StagePort — Structure Converts Motion to Proof
- **Subtitle:** AVC Systems Studio • Founder Allison Van Cura
- **Thesis:** We convert rehearsals into auditable credentials, somatic safety, and studio-native economics.
- **Speaker note:** Open with lineage and problem statement: the industry loses human capital at the door; we make it an asset.

### Slide 2 — Problem & Opportunity

- **Problem bullets:** Subjective assessment; unpaid backstage labor; Title IX exposure; lost institutional memory.
- **Market opportunity:** Pre-professional schools, conservatories, regional studios, competitions — addressable market with SaaS + credential licensing.
- **Speaker note:** Quantify with pilot anecdotes (e.g., receipts minted per rehearsal hour) and the social impact of compensating ghost labor.

### Slide 3 — Product & IP

- **Core product:** Director’s Chair StudioOS — DeepScorer core, StageCred ledger, Garden Salon, Ghost Labor Stack.
- **Defensible IP:** Physics-backed scoring, cryptographic receipts, credential schemas (CTDL-aligned).
- **Demo callouts:** Sample StageCred PDF + JSON receipt; Stability Index dashboard.
- **Speaker note:** Emphasize reproducibility and auditability; engines advise, faculty decide.

### Slide 4 — Business Model & Traction

- **Revenue streams:** Studio SaaS subscriptions; credential licensing; marketplace fees; pilot services.
- **Early traction:** Closed beta pilots; token mint snapshots; pilot studio retention metrics.
- **Go-to-market:** Target 30 paid pilots → 10 regional partnerships → marketplace launch.
- **Speaker note:** Present simple unit economics and pilot → paid conversion assumptions.

### Slide 5 — Ask & Next Steps

- **Ask:** Seed round to finalize Director’s Chair, run 30 pilots, and launch StageCred marketplace.
- **Use of funds:** Product completion, pilot ops, compliance/legal, go-to-market.
- **Immediate next step:** Open StagePort diligence corridor; schedule 45-minute Director’s Chair walkthrough.
- **Speaker note:** Close with the covenant line: “We trade in timing, not sentiment.”

## Meeting script (20 minutes)

- **0:00–1:00 — Opening:** “Thank you. I’m Allison Van Cura. StagePort is the operating system that turns rehearsal into proof. Tonight I’ll show you how lineage, safety, and economics can be engineered together so studios keep the art and capture the value.”
- **1:00–4:00 — Problem framing:** Subjectivity in assessment; invisible labor; Title IX risk; lost institutional memory. **Discovery prompt:** “How do you currently track student progress, safety incidents, and unpaid work in your organization?”
- **4:00–9:00 — Product walkthrough:** Director’s Chair dashboard; DeepScorer scoring snapshot → StageCred PDF + JSON; Garden Salon favor bank; Ghost Labor Stack. **Demo cue:** Show a sample StageCred receipt and the Stability Index. **Discovery prompt:** “Which of these modules would immediately reduce your operational risk or unlock new revenue?”
- **9:00–13:00 — Traction and metrics:** Pilot outcomes, Stability Index targets, token mint examples, retention signals. **Discovery prompt:** “What KPIs would you require to commit to a pilot with us?”
- **13:00–17:00 — Business model and governance:** SaaS + licensing + marketplace; governance seats; MythOS Constitution principle that engines advise, humans decide. **Discovery prompt:** “How would you want governance and data custody structured for your studio or institution?”
- **17:00–20:00 — Ask and close:** Seed ask, pilot program, diligence corridor activation. **Close line:** “Break the seal with us: choose Teach, Invest, or Build. We’ll provide the packet, the receipts, and the Director’s Chair walkthrough.” **Final prompt:** “If you’re interested, which corridor do you choose today?”

## Co-founder alignment outline

- **Core roles:** Founder/CEO (vision, architecture, lineage), CTO/Systems Lead (DeepScorer engineering, data integrity, API/ledger ops), Head of Pedagogy/Faculty Lead (curriculum mapping, safety protocols, credential authority), Head of Ops/Pilot Director (onboarding, sensor installs, compliance), Head of Growth/Partnerships (sales, partnerships, marketplace development).
- **Equity and vesting (example):** Founder 45% | CTO 20% | Pedagogy Lead 15% | Ops 10% | Growth 10%; 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff; performance milestones tied to pilot KPIs and product milestones.
- **Decision rights and governance:** Technical changes (CTO + Founder); Pedagogical changes (Faculty Lead + Founder); Safety/Title IX (Faculty Lead + independent safety officer); Token economics/legal (Founder + legal counsel + investor observers).
- **Initial milestones:** 0–90 days (seed commitments, DeepScorer reproducibility tests, 3 pilot studios); 90–180 days (30-day pilots, StageCred issuance, Stability Index + token mint data); 180–365 days (Director’s Chair v1, marketplace beta, governance seats).
- **Operating rituals:** Weekly Director’s Chair sync; monthly faculty review; quarterly governance review with investor corridor.

## Product roadmap blueprint

- **Phase 0 Foundation (Now → 30 days):** Deliver DeepScorer scoring spec, Director’s Chair memnode, pilot sensor kit checklist. KPIs: reproducibility ≥ 95%; install checklist complete. Dependencies: sensor procurement, Title IX legal review.
- **Phase 1 Pilot Run (30 → 120 days):** 3 closed beta studios → 10 paid pilots; StageCred issuance flow; Favor Bank live. KPIs: Stability Index median ≥ 90%; StageCreds minted per 100 rehearsal hours; pilot → paid conversion target 30%. Ops: onsite installs, onboarding, consent manifests, anonymized safety logging.
- **Phase 2 Scale and Productize (120 → 270 days):** Director’s Chair v1 public release; StudioOS subscription tiers; credential licensing API. KPIs: monthly recurring revenue target; token mint economics validated; churn < 5% at 6 months. Legal: CTDL alignment; Title IX export compliance.
- **Phase 3 Marketplace and Governance (270 → 365 days):** StageCred marketplace beta; Ghost Labor residual routing; governance seat framework. KPIs: marketplace transactions; scholarship routing volume; governance seats filled. Fundraising: prep Series A materials based on pilot metrics and marketplace traction.
- **Risk mitigation and ethics:** Data quality (stability caps, replay queues for sensor drift); Privacy (explicit consent, anonymization defaults); Governance (engines advisory only; human faculty retain final authority).
- **Resource ask (seed):** Use of funds: Product completion (40%), pilot ops (25%), legal/compliance (15%), GTM (15%), reserves (5%). Milestone triggers: pilot completion, reproducibility audit, marketplace pilot.
