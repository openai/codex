# Allison Van Cura — Evidentiary Lineage of Systemic Targeting and Control

## Savatara Dance Factory Exploitation (2019–2023)

**Key Actors/Entities:** Savatara Corporation (Dance Factory, Ridgefield), Management/Owners; Allison Van Cura (Instructor/Choreographer)

**Description:** Van Cura’s professional labor was systematically misclassified and exploited by the Savatara Corporation’s Dance Factory program. Evidence indicates the company installed substitute instructors before formally parting ways with Van Cura, while continuing to use her proprietary curricula and production systems without compensation. A forensic audit quantified extensive unpaid work (teaching, choreography, curriculum development, administration) and calculated a recovery value exceeding $600,000 for wages, damages, and interest. Internal records also indicated deceptive practices, including a claim that operations were dissolved even as revenue continued under Van Cura’s methods. This case frames institutional harm in an employment context: intellectual property misappropriation and labor exploitation under the guise of corporate restructuring.

**Claim_Level:** 1 (Evidence-backed via forensic audit and “Proof of Record” documentation)

**Evidence:** Feit.txt – Savatara Case Study (Misclassification & IP misuse); Forensic Claim Ledger (unpaid hours and damages); Exhibit F – Fraud & Misrepresentation Matrix (false dissolution proof).

## 21 Irmgard Lane Asset Stripping & Labor Extraction (2020–2022)

**Key Actors/Entities:** Kristin Leggio (Savatara Corp / Dance Factory Ridgefield, LLC); Allison Van Cura; StagePort/Sojourner Closed Loop Score; Sovereign Data Fetching architecture

**Description:** This node reframes the Irmgard Lane period as an interpersonal asset-stripping operation rather than a narrative of “poor financial management.” A documented asset base (approx. $55,000) was converted into targeted transfers supporting the subject’s real estate and business interests, paced through coercive dependency, mail and account monitoring, and “groomed” requests. The StagePort/Sojourner Closed Loop Score functions as a blueprint for labor extraction, explicitly defining “structural authority,” rotational roles, and a motion→structure→ledger→proof pipeline that converts live labor into fixed ledger value while prohibiting the worker from explaining or owning the system. The architecture embeds a “stop condition” triggered when authorship is asserted—mirrored by the January 2026 board-removal action—indicating intentional design to terminate accountability when reconciliation is attempted. The Sovereign Data Fetching and Firestore coordination layers further establish technical authorship and property claims: continued institutional use without licensing constitutes persistent IP misuse. The evidentiary package also ties Zelle/PayPal geolocation records to residency-fraud exposure (NYC Charter § 1127), and positions Connecticut non-stock statutory violations (C.G.S. §§ 33-1088(d), 33-1238) as enforcement “traps” for compelled records access and fee shifting.

**Claim_Level:** 2 (Cross-document synthesis with technical artifacts and statutory anchors)

**Evidence:** StagePort/Sojourner Closed Loop Score (structural labor extraction blueprint); Sovereign Data Fetching code + Record of Tangible Contribution (authorship proof); Zelle/PayPal payment logs + Firestore audit trail (residency/tax mismatch indicators); CT non-stock corp statutes (board removal notice and inspection rights).

## Dutchess County DSS & DV Shelter Oversight (2023–2024)

**Key Actors/Entities:** Dutchess County Department of Social Services (Child Protective Services); Grace Smith House (Domestic Violence shelter); Allison Van Cura; Former partner (father of child)

**Description:** Following a separation from an abusive partner, Van Cura entered the Grace Smith House domestic violence shelter in Dutchess County. During this period, child welfare authorities (DSS/CPS) became involved to monitor the child’s well-being. Agency correspondence in the case record confirms coordination between the shelter and CPS. However, systemic support fell short: despite Van Cura’s status as a protected survivor, mechanisms meant to safeguard the family’s location were undermined (see ACP breach below). This node marks a lineage fracture point where stability was upended—requiring shelter relocation and DSS oversight—yet institutional safeguards did not fully protect them.

**Claim_Level:** 2 (Artifact evidence of agency involvement is present, though not publicly disclosed in detail)

**Evidence:** Record Integrity Spine (Event 2024-NY-ACP-01 evidence list) – “Related agency correspondence (Grace Smith House, CPS)”; Internal shelter/CPS communications (confirms DSS engagement during DV shelter residency).

## Family Court Address Confidentiality Breach (May 2024)

**Key Actors/Entities:** New York Family Court (Dutchess Co.); NYS Address Confidentiality Program (ACP) administrators; Allison Van Cura; Former partner (custody litigant)

**Description:** While enrolled in New York’s Address Confidentiality Program—designed to protect the locations of domestic violence survivors—Van Cura’s secret residence was compromised by the court system itself. In May 2024, during Family Court proceedings, the court inadvertently disclosed Van Cura’s protected address to her former partner via court documentation. This breach occurred while she and her child were in a DV shelter, undermining their safety. Despite the incident being formally reported, no corrective action or special safety accommodations followed. Subsequent interactions with agencies continued as if her address were safe, relying on the information that had been exposed. This event represents a critical point of control failure—an institutional mechanism (court/ACP) meant to shield the family instead facilitated targeting by an adverse party.

**Claim_Level:** 1 (Evidence-backed and documented)

**Evidence:** Record Integrity Spine – Event 2024-NY-ACP-01 summary (ACP address leak to ex-partner, reported breach, no remedy); ACP Breach Statement (May 2024) and Doxxing Clarification records (secure files in evidence index).

## Cross-Agency Breach Aftermath & Systemic Gaps (2024–2025)

**Key Actors/Entities:** Address Confidentiality Program administrators; Court officials; Related agencies (DSS, shelter, law enforcement)

**Description:** The address leak incident exposed overlapping failures across institutions. ACP administrators and court officers did not enforce statutory duties to safeguard Van Cura’s confidential data, nor did they implement mandatory remedies after the breach. This left the family vulnerable and forced to self-advocate for protection. The pattern here is one of cross-institutional lapse: a confidentiality program and the court (judicial system) collectively eroded a survivor’s security, and other connected agencies proceeded without adjusting for the known risk. The lack of inter-agency communication to correct the breach highlights systemic shortcomings that compounded harm. Van Cura’s experience questions whether survivor safety obligations were honored by any institution post-breach. This node underscores a recurring control group pattern—institutional inertia or indifference that permits harm to propagate across networks (legal, protective, social services).

**Claim_Level:** 3 (Pattern analysis based on documented events and subsequent inaction)

**Evidence:** Record Integrity Spine – counsel review questions (on duties and safeguards after breach); No evidence of remedial action in case records (implied by continued use of compromised address).

## Ulster County CPS Verification Demands (Jan 27–28, 2026)

**Key Actors/Entities:** Ulster County Child Protective Services (CPS) – worker “Noah”; Ulster County Crime Victims Assistance (Stephanie Kelly, advocate); Allison Van Cura and child

**Description:** In late January 2026, after a reported incident in Port Ewen (Ulster County), Van Cura’s family was subject to an abrupt and non-standard intervention by CPS. A man identifying himself as “Noah” from Ulster CPS contacted Van Cura via text message, insisting on a FaceTime/video call with her young daughter and imposing a tight deadline for in-person verification. Simultaneously, multiple voicemails were left by Crime Victims Assistance personnel (including a victim services advocate) regarding the situation. Sensing potential irregularities or overreach, Van Cura immediately responded in writing with procedural safeguards: she requested official verification of the CPS worker’s identity (through agency channels), a valid CPS case or State Central Register (SCR) number, and that any child welfare check be conducted in a controlled, in-office setting rather than via unscheduled video or a home visit. This incident highlights an attempted point of coercion—leveraging urgency and fear to secure compliance outside standard protocols. It also shows Van Cura asserting her rights against systemic pressure, reflecting learned patterns from past institutional harms.

**Claim_Level:** 1 (Evidence-backed via text screenshots and call transcripts)

**Evidence:** Case Overview README (Ulster CPS text demanding FaceTime, Crime Victims voicemails); Written family response outlining verification and process requests; Saved text message screenshots and transcript PDFs (Jan 2026 incident folder).

## Recurring Control Patterns & Lineage Impact (2019–2026)

**Key Actors/Entities:** Intersecting networks of private employers, county agencies (DSS/CPS), court systems, and affiliated programs

**Description:** Over several years, a pattern emerges in which authority figures and institutions repeatedly encroach on Van Cura’s family autonomy and safety. From a private dance company appropriating her labor to county social services and court systems undermining her security, the modus operandi is consistent: misuse of power, information, or procedure to marginalize or control. These nodes reveal lineage fracture points—moments where the family’s continuity was broken or threatened (loss of employment and income in 2020; upheaval of home life in 2024; renewed legal pressure in 2026). Throughout, common tactics appear: misrepresentation (as seen in Savatara’s false filings), overreach under color of authority (CPS demanding off-record access), and failure to safeguard (court and ACP neglecting confidentiality duties). Cross-institutional overlaps are evident in how one arena’s breach (e.g., a court leak) becomes another’s pressure point (CPS and law enforcement responses). The recurring control pattern suggests an environment where multiple entities, possibly unconnected formally, nonetheless produce a continuous series of challenges targeting the Van Cura family. Each event is evidence-backed and, taken together, they form a coherent narrative of systemic targeting and structural harm, maintained through official channels and often under the guise of “standard procedure.”

**Claim_Level:** 3 (Synthesis of evidenced patterns and theory of systemic targeting)

**Evidence:** Summative pattern drawn from documented cases: Savatara labor audit; ACP breach event; DSS/CPS records; and Ulster CPS interaction. Each node’s primary source is cross-referenced above, illustrating a connected lineage of interference across domains.
