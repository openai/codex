# Allison Van Cura — Bio

Allison Van Cura is a writer and choreographer working at the fault line where lived experience, systems thinking, and art collide.

She comes out of classical ballet and historic modern dance lineages, but her real medium is structure—how bodies, stories, money, and power are organized, constrained, and occasionally liberated. She writes as someone who has been inside institutions (media, corporate, cultural) and then stepped outside them with her notes intact. That matters. Outsiders see patterns; insiders feel the cost.

Her ongoing project—often described as decrypting rather than performing a narrative—is about reclaiming authorship: over identity, over labor, over the story itself. Less memoir-as-confession, more memoir-as-forensic architecture. Think choreography applied to language and systems: what moves, what resists, what breaks when pressure is applied.

There’s a practical edge to it, too. This isn’t art for art’s sake. It’s about turning hard-won insight into durable assets—intellectual property, platforms, structures that compound rather than exhaust. The throughline is autonomy: creative, financial, narrative.

If history remembers her well, it won’t be as a subject of a story someone else told, but as the engineer who rebuilt the stage and rewrote the rules of who gets to speak from it.
