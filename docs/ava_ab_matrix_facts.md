# AVA A/B Matrix — Facts (Draft v1)

**Purpose:** Establish a clean, non-narrative matrix that contrasts asserted claims (A) with record-anchored facts (B), using evidence IDs only. This is the first spine of a larger case dossier.

**Status:** Draft for expansion. Populate Evidence IDs as documents are slotted.

---

## Matrix Legend

- **A = Claim / Framing** (what others imply or state)
- **B = Record-anchored fact** (what the record establishes)
- **Evidence IDs** use stable, numbered references only (no attachments embedded)
- **Jurisdiction** anchors each row where possible

## AVA A/B Matrix — Facts

| ID        | A — Claim / Framing                                 | B — Record-anchored Fact                                                                                                                             | Jurisdiction | Evidence IDs                                   |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| AVA-AB-01 | “No prior professional career.”                     | Public professional activity documented prior to later media involvement (performances, interviews, credits, public competitions).                   | NY/NJ        | EV-2013-01, EV-2013-02, EV-2013-03             |
| AVA-AB-02 | “Inexperienced / unknown / aspirational.”           | Competitive placement, gatekeeper interviews, teaching roles, and choreography authority demonstrate professional standing.                          | NY/NJ        | EV-2013-02, EV-2013-04, EV-2013-05             |
| AVA-AB-03 | “Voice emerged later.”                              | On-record interview(s) and public statements define the work in her own words prior to later visibility.                                             | NY           | EV-2013-03                                     |
| AVA-AB-04 | “Work lacks independent authorship.”                | Prior art exists; common-law copyright attaches automatically to original choreography, poetry, and performances.                                    | NY           | EV-2013-01, EV-2013-04                         |
| AVA-AB-05 | “Identity is defined by one later period.”          | Multi-disciplinary identity established before later events (poetry, dance, teaching, choreography).                                                 | NY/NJ        | EV-2013-01, EV-2013-05                         |
| AVA-AB-06 | “Protected address was handled appropriately.”      | ACP-protected address disclosed during court documentation while in shelter; breach reported without corrective action or safety accommodation.      | NY           | EV-ACP-2024-01, EV-ACP-2024-02, EV-ACP-2024-03 |
| AVA-AB-07 | “Housing actions were routine and proportional.”    | Housing/voucher actions occurred amid documented safety and relocation pressures; procedural inconsistencies require review.                         | NY           | EV-HOUSING-2024-01, EV-HOUSING-2024-02         |
| AVA-AB-08 | “Media representations were complete and accurate.” | Media/platform framing omitted professional context, narrowing public understanding across jurisdictions.                                            | CA           | EV-MEDIA-01, EV-MEDIA-02, EV-MEDIA-03          |
| AVA-AB-09 | “CPS escalation followed standard thresholds.”      | CPS procedures escalated during safety/housing crisis; requests for clarification and accommodation were made while documentation burdens increased. | NY           | EV-CPS-01, EV-CPS-02, EV-CPS-03                |
| AVA-AB-10 | “No material labor replacement occurred.”           | Sustained multi-year labor replaced institutional functions; valuation exists as a conservative estimate pending counsel review.                     | NY           | EV-LABOR-01                                    |

## Evidence ID Conventions

Use the following stable pattern to avoid drift:

- **EV-YYYY-##** for dated public record (e.g., EV-2013-01)
- **EV-ACP-YYYY-##** for ACP and address protection records
- **EV-HOUSING-YYYY-##** for housing/voucher records
- **EV-MEDIA-##** for media/platform artifacts
- **EV-CPS-##** for CPS-related records
- **EV-LABOR-##** for labor valuation documentation

---

## Next Insertions (Optional)

Add these as new rows once evidence is slotted:

- **Publicity / false-light exposure points** (jurisdiction-specific)
- **Unjust enrichment vectors** (benefit traceability)
- **Career trajectory disruption markers** (lost opportunities, time loss)
- **Remedy pathways** (structured support mechanisms, indexed)
