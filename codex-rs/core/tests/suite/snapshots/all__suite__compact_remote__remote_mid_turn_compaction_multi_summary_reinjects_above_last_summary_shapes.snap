Scenario: After a prior manual /compact produced REMOTE_OLDER_SUMMARY, the next turn hits remote auto-compaction before the next sampling request. The compact request keeps only user-visible history (including the older summary), and the next sampling request shows the new summary plus canonical context reinjected before USER_TWO.
