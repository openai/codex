## Overview
`common::sandbox_mode_cli_arg` declares `SandboxModeCliArg`, the shared Clap enum backing the `--sandbox`/`-s` flag in Codex CLI tools. It exposes the primary sandbox modes in a user-friendly form and converts selections into `codex_protocol::config_types::SandboxMode` for downstream configuration.

## Detailed Behavior
- Derives `ValueEnum` with kebab-case variants (`read-only`, `workspace-write`, `danger-full-access`), aligning the CLI syntax with documentation and preset descriptions.
- Each variant maps directly to the corresponding `SandboxMode` via a `From` implementation, ensuring conversion is exhaustive and compiler-checked.
- The module-level docs clarify that advanced workspace-write options remain accessible through configuration overrides, keeping the enum focused on the common cases.

## Broader Context
- Keeps sandbox option naming and behavior consistent across binaries, mirroring the presets defined in `approval_presets` and the summaries generated by `sandbox_summary`.
- Consumers enabling the `cli` feature gain the enum automatically; GUI or service contexts can ignore it to avoid the Clap dependency.
- Context can't yet be determined for future sandbox variants (e.g., enterprise-specific policies); new modes should be added here to maintain cohesion.

## Technical Debt
- None observed; the enum is minimal and matches the upstream configuration type.
