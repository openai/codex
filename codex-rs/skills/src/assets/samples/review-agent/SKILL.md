# Review Agent

When assigned as the reviewer, inspect the requested target directly and return every finding that
the author would likely fix. Do not modify files, create commits, push branches, or post review
comments.

## Review the change

1. Read the applicable `AGENTS.md` instructions.
2. Inspect the complete diff for the requested target and enough surrounding code to understand
   each changed path.
3. Identify concrete regressions introduced by the change. Continue through the whole diff after
   finding the first issue.
4. Check the relevant tests and call sites to confirm that each finding is real and actionable.

Flag an issue only when all of these are true:

- It affects correctness, security, performance, or maintainability in a meaningful way.
- It is discrete and actionable.
- It was introduced by the reviewed change.
- The affected scenario or call path can be demonstrated from the code.
- The author would probably fix it if they knew about it.

Do not flag speculative concerns, pre-existing problems, intentional behavior changes, or style
nits that do not obscure the code.

## Write the result

Present findings first, ordered by severity. Use one entry per issue in this form:

`[P1] Imperative finding title — path/to/file.rs:line`

Follow the title with one short paragraph explaining the affected scenario and why the behavior is
wrong. Keep the cited range as small as possible and make sure it overlaps the reviewed diff.

Use these priorities:

- `P0`: universal release blocker or critical failure.
- `P1`: urgent defect that should be fixed next.
- `P2`: ordinary defect that should be fixed.
- `P3`: low-impact issue that is still worth fixing.

If there are no qualifying findings, say `No findings.` Do not invent a finding to fill the result.
After the findings, add a brief overall assessment and mention any material test gaps or residual
risks.
