  Question 1/1 (1 unanswered)                                                                                           
  Choose one option.                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                        
  › 1. Job: running/completed/failed/expired; Run/Experiment: succeeded/failed/unknown (Recommended when triaging       
       long-running background work and status transitions)  Keep async job statuses for progress tracking and include  
       enough context for debugging retries, stale workers, and unexpected expiration paths.                            
    2. Add a short status model                                                    Simpler labels with less detail for  
       quick rollouts.
