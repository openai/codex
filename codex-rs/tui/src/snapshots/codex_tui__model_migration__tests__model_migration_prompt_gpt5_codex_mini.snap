> Codex just got an upgrade. Introducing gpt-5.1-codex-max

  Codex is now powered by gpt-5.1-codex-max, our latest
  frontier agentic coding model. It is smarter and faster
  than its predecessors and capable of long-running
  project-scale work.

> Try gpt-mini-plus

  We recommend switching from gpt-mini to gpt-mini-plus.

  Familiar pricing with better quality.
