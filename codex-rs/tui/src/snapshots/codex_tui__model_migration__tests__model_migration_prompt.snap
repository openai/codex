  Codex is now powered by gpt-5.1-codex-max, our latest
  frontier agentic coding model. It is smarter and faster
  than its predecessors and capable of long-running
  project-scale work.

  We recommend switching from gpt-5.1-codex-mini to
  gpt-5.1-codex-max.

  Latest Codex-optimized flagship for deep and fast
  reasoning.
