For each object, output a single JSON line with the same `id`, a boolean `include`, and a short `reason`.\n- Use include=true for files that likely influence production behaviour, handle user input, touch the network/filesystem, perform authentication/authorization, execute commands, or otherwise impact security.\n- Use include=false for files that are clearly documentation, tests, CI workflows/harnesses, generated artefacts, or otherwise irrelevant to production security review.\n  - Default exclude common non-production areas like: `tests/`, `test/`, `__tests__/`, `.github/`, `.circleci/`, `ci/`, `tools/ci/`, `scripts/ci/`.\n  - Only include such files if they are directly relevant to a security finding (e.g., they handle real credentials used in production) or are explicitly in scope.\n\nReply with one JSON object per line in this exact form:\n{\"id\": <number>, \"include\": true|false, \"reason\": \"...\"}\n\nFiles:\n{files}";
