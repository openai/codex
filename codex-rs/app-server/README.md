# User verification cancellation (experimental)

Local UI clients can cancel a native user-verification RPC by sending
`userVerification/cancel` with `{requestId}` and the `experimentalApi` opt-in.
The result is an empty acknowledgment (`{}`). This API does not enable desktop
verification capability advertisement.

`requestId` is the original status, enroll, delete, or verify RPC's string or
integer ID on the same connection, not the server elicitation ID. Use fresh IDs
for each operation and a distinct ID for the cancel RPC. Unknown, finished,
unrelated, and other-connection requests are no-ops.

The acknowledgment confirms the cancellation signal without waiting for the OS
prompt to close. The original RPC completes independently, with
`cancelled/interrupted` when cancellation prevents completion. Cancellation
cannot roll back completed effects. It remains effective while a proof waits for
outbound queue capacity, but cannot retract a response already enqueued.

Canceling or resolving an elicitation does not itself stop a separate
`userVerification/verify` RPC. Clients must cancel that RPC separately and discard
late proofs after the approval is canceled or resolved. Only one native worker
runs per app-server; if an OS call remains active after cancellation or timeout,
subsequent local operations return `failed/providerError` until that worker exits.

# Hosted Codex Apps MCP protocol

The host-owned HTTP `codex_apps` server uses Legacy by default in app-server and
standalone Codex. To discover the 2026-07-28 protocol, set
`codex_apps_mcp_2026_07_28 = true` under `[features]`, or send a true runtime
override via `experimentalFeature/enablement/set`. Discovery falls back to Legacy
when the server does not support it. Explicit config takes precedence.
The dedicated setting does not apply to third-party HTTP or local `codex_app`
stdio servers. The existing `mcp_2026_07_28` flag still governs eligible other
servers, regardless of whether their names or URLs resemble hosted Apps.
App-server does not persist this selection.

# Thread removal

`thread/archive` and `thread/delete` reject attempts to remove a live internal
worker with JSON-RPC error `-32600`. The worker's owner controls its shutdown.
For example, a Guardian reviewer remains available to its parent conversation
after a client tries to archive or delete it.

After the owner releases the worker, its saved conversation can be archived or
deleted normally. Ordinary client-controlled threads keep their existing behavior.

# Amazon Bedrock authentication

If `model_providers.amazon-bedrock.aws.credential_export` is configured, Bedrock setup and
Bedrock login return an error without changing configuration or saved credentials. Remove the
exporter configuration before selecting another credential source. `aws.credential_export` and
`aws.profile` cannot be configured together.

## Stored thread attachments

- `thread/attachment/add` — add a durable resource reference to a stored thread without loading it. Repeated writes with the same attachment type and identity key return the existing attachment.
- `thread/attachment/list` — list attachments for one stored thread in a cursor-paginated request, including a thread that is not loaded.
- `thread/attachment/remove` — remove an attachment by its thread, attachment type, and identity key; returns `{}`.
- `thread/attachment/updated` — notification broadcast after an attachment is created or removed; contains the thread, attachment identity, attachment id, and operation.
### Example: Manage stored thread attachments

Attachments record the resources currently associated with a thread, independently of conversation history. Clients can add, remove, and list attachments for one stored thread at a time without resuming those threads. Adding or removing an attachment does not create or delete the underlying resource or rewrite history. An attachment is idempotently identified by its thread, `attachmentType`, and `identityKey`. For pull requests, clients should reuse the canonical application identity `JSON.stringify([canonicalHostname, lowercaseOwner, lowercaseRepository, pullRequestNumber])` so addition and removal agree across surfaces.

```json
{ "method": "thread/attachment/add", "id": 20, "params": {
    "threadId": "thr_123",
    "attachmentType": "pull_request",
    "identityKey": "[\"github.com\",\"openai\",\"codex\",123]",
    "payload": { "url": "https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/123" }
} }
{ "id": 20, "result": {
    "outcome": "created",
    "attachment": {
        "id": "01984de2-8f74-7c91-a3b2-5c5e937cf318",
        "attachmentType": "pull_request",
        "identityKey": "[\"github.com\",\"openai\",\"codex\",123]",
        "payload": { "url": "https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/123" },
        "createdAt": 1750000000
    }
} }

{ "method": "thread/attachment/list", "id": 21, "params": {
    "threadId": "thr_123",
    "limit": 100
} }
{ "id": 21, "result": {
    "data": [{
        "id": "01984de2-8f74-7c91-a3b2-5c5e937cf318",
        "attachmentType": "pull_request",
        "identityKey": "[\"github.com\",\"openai\",\"codex\",123]",
        "payload": { "url": "https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/123" },
        "createdAt": 1750000000
    }],
    "nextCursor": null
} }

{ "method": "thread/attachment/remove", "id": 22, "params": {
    "threadId": "thr_123",
    "attachmentType": "pull_request",
    "identityKey": "[\"github.com\",\"openai\",\"codex\",123]"
} }
{ "id": 22, "result": {} }

{ "method": "thread/attachment/updated", "params": {
    "threadId": "thr_123",
    "attachmentType": "pull_request",
    "identityKey": "[\"github.com\",\"openai\",\"codex\",123]",
    "attachmentId": "01984de2-8f74-7c91-a3b2-5c5e937cf318",
    "operation": "deleted"
} }
```

`thread/attachment/list` accepts one `threadId` and returns at most 100 attachments per page, ordered by creation time and attachment id. Continue with `nextCursor` and the same `threadId` until the cursor is `null`. Each thread can retain up to 100 attachments. Removing an attachment frees a slot for a new attachment.

Attachment creation and deletion requests using the same thread ID are serialized across connections. The requesting client receives its response before the compact update is broadcast, and duplicate creates or absent deletes do not emit updates. Deleting the owning thread removes its attachments under the same lifecycle exclusion; queued attachment mutations then report that the thread was not found.
