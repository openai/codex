### Version 1: Technical Focus
```
🚀 Just implemented Meta-Orchestration in Codex! 

AI can now use itself as a sub-agent via MCP protocol—creating a self-referential system with infinite scalability.

✨ Features:
• Parallel execution (tokio::spawn)
• Custom agent generation from prompts
• Recursive AI coordination

```
🚀 Announcing Codex Meta-Orchestration

I'm excited to share a breakthrough in AI agent coordination: Codex can now use itself as a sub-agent through the MCP protocol.

What we built:
• Parallel execution system (tokio::spawn)
• Dynamic agent creation from natural language
• Self-referential AI architecture

This creates a recursive system where AI orchestrates AI, unlocking infinite scalability and extensibility.

Technical Stack:
- Rust (for performance & safety)
- MCP Protocol (standard integration)
- Async runtime (tokio)

The implications are profound: modular, scalable, and self-improving AI systems.

Full implementation details and code available on GitHub.

### For X Thread (if you want to expand):
```
🧵 1/ Just shipped Codex Meta-Orchestration

2/ Key innovation: AI using AI as tools via MCP protocol

3/ Architecture: Parent Codex → MCP Client → Child Codex (stdio)

4/ Each child is isolated, secure, resource-limited

5/ Real benefit: Infinite scalability + modular extensibility

6/ Built in 17 mins, 38.5MB binary, pure Rust

7/ Open-source, MCP-standard compliant

8/ This is the future of AI coordination 🚀
```
