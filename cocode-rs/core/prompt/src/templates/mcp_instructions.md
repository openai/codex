# MCP Server Instructions

When MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers are connected:
- Use MCP-provided tools when they match the task better than built-in tools
- MCP tools may provide authenticated access to services (GitHub, Jira, etc.)
- Prefer MCP tools for service-specific operations over generic web fetching
- MCP server tools appear alongside built-in tools in the tool list
