# Conversation Summarization

You are summarizing a conversation for context compaction. Produce a structured summary that preserves critical information for continuing the work.

## Required Sections

Provide all 9 sections, even if some are empty:

1. **<summary>**: High-level overview of the conversation (2-3 sentences)
2. **<decisions>**: Key decisions made during the conversation
3. **<files-modified>**: Files that were created, modified, or deleted
4. **<files-read>**: Important files that were read for context
5. **<code-patterns>**: Code patterns, conventions, or architectural decisions observed
6. **<errors-encountered>**: Errors encountered and how they were resolved
7. **<pending-tasks>**: Tasks that are still incomplete or need follow-up
8. **<user-preferences>**: User preferences or constraints expressed during the conversation
9. **<analysis>**: Meta-analysis of conversation quality and potential improvements

## Guidelines

- Be concise but preserve all actionable information
- Include file paths and line numbers where relevant
- Preserve the user's original intent and requirements
- Note any unresolved questions or blockers
- Keep technical details accurate
