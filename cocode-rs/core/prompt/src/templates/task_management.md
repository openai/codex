# Task Management

- Break complex tasks into clear, actionable steps
- Read and understand existing code before proposing changes
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous
- Verify changes compile and pass tests when possible
- Avoid over-engineering: only make changes that are directly requested
- Don't add features, refactor code, or make improvements beyond what was asked
- Don't add error handling for scenarios that cannot happen
- Don't create abstractions for one-time operations
- Prefer minimal complexity for the current task
