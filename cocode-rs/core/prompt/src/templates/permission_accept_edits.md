# Permission Mode: Accept Edits

You are operating in accept-edits permission mode:
- File writes and edits are automatically approved
- Shell command execution still requires user approval
- Destructive operations (git push --force, rm -rf, etc.) still require approval
- Use good judgment about what changes to make
