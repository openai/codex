## A. LinkedIn DM — concise (ML Lead)

Hi [Name], I’m Allison — a Senior Annotation Architect. I design taxonomy + gold standards that cut labeling time ~3× and reduce relabel cycles. I’m offering a 1-week paid pilot (500 examples + 200-item gold set + Label Studio config) for $1.5k so you can judge quality fast. Want a quick 10-minute call this week to review a 2-page sample gold set? — Allison

## B. LinkedIn DM — Product Manager (longer)

Hi [Name], I’m Allison Van Cura. I help product teams get production-ready datasets faster by turning ambiguous labeling into repeatable ops — taxonomy, gold standard, and QA dashboards. Typical outcome: measurable IAB improvements and 3× faster effective labeling. I’d love to run a 1-week pilot (taxonomy + gold + Label Studio) for $1.5k and show you results. Do you have 15 minutes to review a sample and acceptance criteria? Thanks — Allison

## C. Cold email — CTO / Head of ML

Subject: 7-day pilot to fix label drift & speed dataset delivery
Hi [Name],
I specialize in dataset ops that let ML teams stop wasting weeks on relabel cycles. For $1,500 I’ll deliver in 7 days: a production taxonomy, a 200-item audit-ready gold set, 300–500 labeled examples, and a Label Studio export with keyboard shortcuts and QA metrics. The pilot proves quality (IAB + error taxonomy) so you can scale without rework. May I share a short sample gold set and three time slots this week? — Allison Van Cura, acfwrites@gmail.com

## D. Email to VC partner / portfolio ops

Subject: Quick pilot offer for your portfolio teams — label ops that scale
Hi [Name],
I’m Allison Van Cura — I help early ML teams ship models faster by fixing labeling at the source. I can offer your portfolio a discounted 1-week pilot for $1,200 (500 examples + a 200-item gold set + Label Studio). I’ll show IAB and throughput improvements in one week. If useful, I’ll share a one-page note you can forward with details and a sample gold set. Best, Allison
